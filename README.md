# ðŸŒŸ Next Word Prediction Using LSTM ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the Next Word Prediction app, built using TensorFlow and Streamlit! This app demonstrates two different implementations of an LSTM-based model for predicting the next word in a sentence.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- Numpy
- Regex
- Matplotlib (for the first app)

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow streamlit numpy regex matplotlib
```

## First App: Training the Model On-the-Fly

This app allows you to upload a text file and train an LSTM model on-the-fly.

- Upload your text file: Choose a .txt file containing the text data.
- Train the model: The model will be trained and validated on the uploaded text data.
- Predict the next words: Enter some seed text and specify the number of words to predict. The app will generate the next words based on your input.

## Second App: Using a Pre-trained Model

This app loads a pre-trained LSTM model to predict the next words in a sentence.

- Load the model and tokenizer: The pre-trained model (model.h5) and tokenizer are loaded.
- Predict the next words: Enter some seed text and specify the number of words to predict. The app will generate the next words based on your input.
